# Prerequisites to build locally

1. Install [nvm] ([nvm for Windows]), a tool to manage `Node.js` versions.
2. Restart your terminal so that `nvm` command is recognized.
3. Using `nvm`, install `Node.js` version `LTS`. This is the version used by the [PR CI pipeline] to build `LintDiff`.
   - Linux: `nvm install --lts`
   - Windows: `nvm install lts`
   - `node --version`, to confirm.
4. Note that installing `Node.js` will also install `npm`.
5. Install [@Microsoft/Rush](https://rushjs.io/).
   - `npm install -g @microsoft/rush`

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
[nvm for Windows]: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
[PR CI pipeline]: https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build?definitionId=5261&_a=summary

# How to prepare for a PR submission after you made changes locally

A lot of the instructions below replicate what the [PR CI pipeline] is doing.

1. Ensure you have fulfilled [`Prerequisites to build locally`](#prerequisites-to-build-locally).
1. Ensure your local clone branch is based on an up-to-date `main` branch.
    - If you are using a fork, ensure your fork `main` branch is up-to-date with
    the origin `main` branch and that your branch is based on your fork `main` branch.
1. If you want for your changes to be deployed to production LintDiff, not only Staging LintDiff, follow the instructions
  given in [`How to deploy your changes`](#how-to-deploy-your-changes).
1. Run [`rush prep`](https://github.com/bdefoy/azure-openapi-validator/blob/b70f43e4ef0182daa8445ae641f7f43dac675789/common/config/rush/command-line.json#LL63C16-L63C20).
It may require some interactivity from you to update changelog. All steps must succeed.
1. If the change is significant, you might consider manually adding appropriate entry to [`changelog.md`](https://github.com/bdefoy/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/changelog.md?plain=1).
1. You are now ready to submit your PR.
1. After your PR is merged, most likely you will want to read [`How to deploy your changes`](#how-to-deploy-your-changes)
to verify they got deployed.

The `rush prep` script is going to execute following commands. You can run them one by one instead of `rush prep` to
have more control over the process and debug any issues.

1. Run `rush update` to ensure all the required modules are installed.
1. Run `rush build` to regenerate relevant files that need to be checked-in.
    - Sometimes this will result in pending changes that will disappear once you do `git commit`.
    This presumably is caused by line ending differences that get smoothed-over by git upon commit.
1. Run `rush lint`. It must pass. If it doesn't, you can debug with `rush lint --verbose`.
    > **TIP**: this repository has [prettier configured as auto-formatter](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/aa7c987f73d163cb5f2810a5323a61bb869bb4e5/.vscode/settings.json#LL8C17-L8C17).
    Consider taking advantage of it.
1. Run `rush test` to run the unit tests. They should all pass.
1. If you changed the ruleset, run `rush regen-ruleindex` to update contents of `docs/rules.md`.
   For details, see `How to refresh the index of rules documentation`.
1. Run `rush change` to generate changelog. You will need to follow the interactive prompts.
   Ensure to follow the [guidelines for authoring Rush changelogs](https://rushjs.io/pages/best_practices/change_logs/).
   You can edit the added files later. If you don't add the right entries, the CI build will fail.

# How to add and roll out new linter rules

This section describes the process for adding a new rule to a ruleset.

## Communicate the addition of a rule to API reviewers

If you are adding a new ARM (control plane) rule, use the [ARM linter rules teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a4f661242c446452e895359cc3ef45125%40thread.tacv2/ARM%2520linter%2520rules?groupId=0cab4ce9-7691-42ae-82e3-460d4346a710&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
to discuss the rule.

## Ensure TypeSpec supports the new rule

Before a rule is implemented (especially any error-severity rules), TypeSpec should support creating specs that follow
the rule. Reach out to the TypeSpec team via the [TypeSpec teams channel](https://aka.ms/typespec/discussions).

## Add a new rule to the staging pipeline

You should first add the rule to the staging pipeline of the API specs repos, where it will not block API specs from
being merged to production. While the rule is in the staging pipeline, you can verify the rule is correctly
marking violations.

To add a rule to the staging pipeline:

1. Ensure the new rule is set to run [only in staging](#how-to-set-a-spectral-rule-to-run-only-in-staging)

2. Merge the new rule to the main branch. Once merged, your new rule will start running in the staging pipeline. You can
verify the rule is running with the instructions in [Verify the deployed changes](#verify-the-deployed-changes).

## Determine which rules are ready for release

Use data from staging pipeline runs to determine if a rule is ready for release.

To review Staging LintDiff pipeline build logs to see if the rules work correctly,

1. [Get access to CloudMine](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/621/Telemetry)
to see the build logs for the public and private API specs repos

2. Use Kusto to find PRs that ran your new rule:

    ```kusto
    // edit these as desired
    let beginTime = ago(7d);
    let violationTimeBin = 10m;
    let includeStagingPipeline = true;
    let includeProdPipeline = false;
    let ruleName = "ReservedResourceNamesModelAsEnum";
    // do not edit these
    let prodPipelineName = "Azure.azure-rest-api-specs-pipeline";
    let stagingPipelineName = "Azure.azure-rest-api-specs-pipeline-staging";
    let lintDiffLogId = 62;
    let lintDiffLogMessageStart = '[{"type":"Result"';
    Build
    | where StartTime > beginTime
    | extend PipelineName = parse_json(Data).definition.name
    | where PipelineName in (iff(includeStagingPipeline, stagingPipelineName, prodPipelineName), iff(includeProdPipeline, prodPipelineName, stagingPipelineName))
    | extend SplitBranch = split(SourceBranch, "/")
    | extend PullRequestLink = strcat("https://github.com/", SplitBranch[3], "/", SplitBranch[4], "/pull/", SplitBranch[5])
    | extend BuildLink = tostring(parse_json(Data)._links.web.href)
    | project StartTime, BuildId, SourceBranch, SourceVersion, PipelineName, PullRequestLink, BuildLink
    | join kind=inner
      (
      BuildLogLine
      | where Timestamp > beginTime
      | where LogId == lintDiffLogId
      | where Message startswith_cs lintDiffLogMessageStart
      | extend LintDiffViolations = parse_json(Message)
      | mv-expand LintDiffViolations
      | extend ViolationCode = tostring(LintDiffViolations.code)
      | where ViolationCode == ruleName
      )
      on BuildId
    | summarize count() by Time=bin(Timestamp, violationTimeBin), ViolationCode, PullRequestLink, BuildLink
    | sort by count_ desc
    ```

    This will give you a list of the builds where the spec violated your rule and the count of violations for that build.
    It includes a link to the PR as well. Using this list, visit the build page, click on LintDiff to view the logs, and
    see where the rule was violated, you can then find that line in the spec by viewing the PR.

3. Wait until your rule has run on **at least 10 different PRs** and you have verified there are no false positives

4. It might also be helpful to view more than only the LintDiff results. You can use this Kusto query to see violations
of your new rule for an API spec without taking into account the previous version of the spec:

    ```kusto
    // edit these as desired
    let beginTime = ago(7d);
    let violationTimeBin = 10m;
    let includeStagingPipeline = true;
    let includeProdPipeline = false;
    let ruleName = "ReservedResourceNamesModelAsEnum";
    // do not edit these
    let prodPipelineName = "Azure.azure-rest-api-specs-pipeline";
    let stagingPipelineName = "Azure.azure-rest-api-specs-pipeline-staging";
    let lintDiffLogId = 62;
    let lintDiffLogMessageStart = "          \"code\":";
    Build
    | where StartTime > beginTime
    | extend PipelineName = parse_json(Data).definition.name
    | where PipelineName in (iff(includeStagingPipeline, stagingPipelineName, prodPipelineName), iff(includeProdPipeline, prodPipelineName, stagingPipelineName))
    | extend SplitBranch = split(SourceBranch, "/")
    | extend PullRequestLink = strcat("https://github.com/", SplitBranch[3], "/", SplitBranch[4], "/pull/", SplitBranch[5])
    | extend BuildLink = tostring(parse_json(Data)._links.web.href)
    | project StartTime, BuildId, SourceBranch, SourceVersion, PipelineName, PullRequestLink, BuildLink
    | join kind=inner
      (
      BuildLogLine
      | where Timestamp > beginTime
      | where LogId == lintDiffLogId
      | where Message startswith_cs lintDiffLogMessageStart
      | extend ViolationCode=trim_end('",', substring(Message, indexof(Message, ': "')+3))
      | where ViolationCode == ruleName
      )
      on BuildId
    | summarize count() by Time=bin(Timestamp, violationTimeBin), ViolationCode, PullRequestLink, BuildLink
    | sort by count_ desc
    ```

5. Additionally, look for any violations of your rule that come from TypeSpec-generated API specs. You can
determine that an API spec is TypeSpec-generated if it has the following under the `info` property:

    ```json
    "x-typespec-generated": [
      {
        "emitter": "@azure-tools/typespec-autorest"
      }
    ]
    ```

## Create a release PR and generate the changelog

After verifying the rule is working as intended, add the rule to the production pipeline so that API specs that violate
the rule will be blocked from merging into production branches.

Follow the steps under [Create a release PR](#create-a-release-pr) to create a PR for your release.

## Create a release tag

Once your release PR is merged, you can create a release tag in GitHub. This will make it easier to look up what changes
were part of the release in the future.

From GitHub, [create a new release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/releases/new) of **`azure-openapi-validator`**.
Make sure to put the changelog in for the release notes.

## Build and publish the release

Once you have verified the rule works correctly, follow the steps under [Deploy to Prod LintDiff](#deploy-to-prod-lintdiff)
to build and publish the release.

## Send the changelog out to partners

Draft an email with all the release notes for ARM partners. Have a team member review the email, and send it out. Below
is a sample email:

> Hello ARM Partners,
>
> We are excited to announce a new release of the Azure OpenAPI validator, a tool that helps you validate your OpenAPI
> specifications for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) APIs. This tool is automatically run as part of the “Swagger LintDiff”
> pipeline for ARM API specifications in the public and private Azure REST API Specifications repositories. This release
> includes new linter rules and updates/fixes to existing linter rules that will help you improve the quality and
> consistency of your APIs.
>
> The new linter rules are as follows:
>
> - PutResponseCodes
> - PostResponseCodes
> - LatestVersionOfCommonTypesMustBeUsed
> - PatchPropertiesCorrespondToPutProperties
> - DeleteResponseCodes
> - AvoidAdditionalProperties
> - ReservedResourceNamesModelAsEnum
> - OperationsApiTenantLevelOnly
>
> The updates/fixes to existing linter rules address the following issues:
>
> - False positives and false negatives
> - Rule severity levels
> - Rule documentation
> - Rule messages
>
> Please note that the changes in this release do not introduce any new requirements that were not already there. They
> should have previously been caught by the ARM API reviewers but now are being enforced via the linter rules. This update
> means that you may see some new validation errors or warnings when you run the validator on your existing OpenAPI
> specifications. We recommend that you fix these issues as soon as possible to ensure that your APIs comply with the ARM
> API standards and best practices.
>
> You can find more details about the linter rules in the documentation. The full changelog is attached to this message.
> You can also access the validator online here.
>
> We appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve the Azure OpenAPI validator. Please feel free to reach
> out to us in the API Spec Review channel, ask general questions with the ‘arm-api’ tag on Stack Overflow, or open an
> issue in the sdk-tools repo with the prefix `[LintDiff]` in the title.
>
> Thank you for your continued partnership and collaboration,
>
> The ARM RPC (Resource Provider Contract) Governance team

## Monitor the new rules and roll forward to disable bad rules

If, after deploying to production, you find the rule is not behaving correctly, move it back to the staging pipeline
while you fix it by following the steps in [How to set a Spectral rule to run only in staging](#how-to-set-a-spectral-rule-to-run-only-in-staging).
Make sure to follow the step for deploying your changes to ensure the rule stops running in production. You should then validate
the rule is not running in production with as described in
[How to verify which Spectral rules are running in Production and Staging LintDiff](#how-to-verify-which-spectral-rules-are-running-in-production-and-staging-lintdiff)

# How to deploy your changes

Let's assume you followed most of the instructions given in [`How to prepare for a PR submission after you made changes locally`](#how-to-prepare-for-a-pr-submission-after-you-made-changes-locally).
You are about to submit your PR, but you want to ensure the changes in your PR will end up correctly deployed.

## Deploy to Staging LintDiff

If you want your changes to be deployed only to the [Staging pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=3268)
and hence Staging LintDiff, you don't need to change anything in your PR.

Once your PR is merged, do the following:

- Ensure the [Staging build] triggered. The build also triggers on schedule once a day.
  If it didn't trigger, trigger it manually.
- Once the build is complete, verify the [Staging npm release] triggered for that build.
  If it didn't trigger, trigger it manually.
- Note that sometimes the npm release may report failure even when it succeeded. This is because sometimes it tries to
  publish package twice and succeeds only on the first try.
- Verify the release worked by the `beta` versions of appropriate packages being released to npm.
  See [README `packages` section]. You can also look at the release build log.

## Deploy to Prod LintDiff

> [!CAUTION]
> Any changes under [packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest] require careful deployment in sync with updates to
> `LINT_VERSION` in `openapi-alps` repository. Otherwise we risk breaking the production LintDiff. See e.g. [iss #653].

If you want your changes to be deployed to [production pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=1736&_a=summary)
you must ensure appropriate packages versions are updated.
You can find the list of all packages in the [README `packages` section].

Here is what you need to do, step by step:

### Create a release PR

If you want your changes to be deployed to [production pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=1736&_a=summary)
and hence Production LintDiff, you need to do the following:

- In the PR with your changes, increase the version number of the *changed packages* using [`rush version --bump`](https://rushjs.io/pages/commands/rush_version/).
  - A *package* encompasses a directory in which a **`package.json`** file is located (see the [npm docs on package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json)
  for more info). The package version is defined in this file.
  - Only update the version number for the relevant package(s) you want to deploy. For example, if your changes are made
  to the files under the [packages/rulesets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/tree/main/packages/rulesets)
  directory, then update the version in [packages/rulesets/package.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/packages/rulesets/package.json#L3).
  The same applies to all the other package directories in [packages directory](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/tree/main/packages).
    - Example for changes made to files under `rulesets` folder - [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/pull/506/files#diff-cad0ec93b3ac24499b20ae58530a4c3e7f369bde5ba1250dea8cad8201e75c30).
    - Example for changes made to files under [`autorest` folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/tree/main/packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest) -
      [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/pull/506/files#diff-359645f2d25015199598e139bc9b03c9fec5d5b1a4a0ae1f1e4f7a651675e6bf).
  - **!!! IMPORTANT !!!**: If you are updating [packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest], see [this section](#synchronize-with-changes-to-openapi-alps-repository).
  - Rush should automatically determine if the changes call for a [patch or minor](https://semver.org/#summary) version
  update and modify the relevant files. Note that if you see a change in the major version, this is likely a mistake. **Do
  not increase the major version.** Only patch or minor, as applicable. If your change justifies major version change,
  ensure the tool owner reviewed your PR.
  - Rush will also generate a changelog from the individual change files, deleting the individual files in the process.
  - Note: `rush version --bump` will update *all* of the changed packages. If you wish only to update one package (e.g.,
   `@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator-rulesets`), discard all of the changes Rush generated for the other packages.
   Make sure to **revert the version number(s) for packages you do not intend to update** in `dependencies` and/or `devDependencies`
   of the **`package.json`** for the package you are updating.
    - You can use [`git restore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore) to quickly discard changes. For example,
    `git restore packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest/*` would restore all the files in the AutoRest package directory.

### Synchronize with changes to `openapi-alps` repository

> [!CAUTION]
> Not following these steps will likely break production LintDiff.
> See [iss #653] for an example.

Changes to the AutoRest extension package, in [packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest],
used by Production LintDiff,  require additional code updates to `openapi-alps` ADO repository,
and deployment of them **in the right order**. Work with this tool owner to apply these steps.
Example of such past deployment is given [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/issues/6071#issuecomment-1530128107),
with [this PR](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/openapi-alps/pullrequest/468946?_a=files)
updating the `LINT_VERSION` value.

### Build and publish the release to npm

Once your PR is merged:

- Schedule a [Prod build] from the `main` branch.
- **!!! IMPORTANT !!!**: If you are updating [packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest], see [this section](#synchronize-with-changes-to-openapi-alps-repository).
- You may need to get an approval for the release from the appropriate [Azure SDK EngSys team members](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A59dbfadafb5e41c4890e2cd3d74cc7ba%40thread.skype/Engineering%20System%20%F0%9F%9B%A0%EF%B8%8F?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121).
- Verify the release worked by new versions of the appropriate packages being released to npm.
  See [README `packages` section]. You can also look at the release build log.

## Verify the deployed changes

If the changes you deployed include changes to the Spectral ruleset, you can verify the changes got deployed by following
the guidance given in `How to verify which Spectral rules are running in Production and Staging LintDiff`.

## Hotfix broken Production LintDiff (breakglass)

In case a newly deployed update to Production LintDiff is causing issues,
Azure SDK Engineering System team can hotfix this by updating the `latest`
tag of the affected package(s) to the last known good version.

This can be achieved by running the [`js - npm-admin-tasks`] pipeline whose
source is [`npm-tasks.yml`]. Example config used to hotfix [iss #653]:

``` powershell
askType : "AddTag"
PackageName : "\"@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator-rulesets\""
PkgVersion : "1.3.2"
TagName : "latest"
Reason : "Regression analyzing TypeSpec-generated swagger"
```

# How to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure occurring on a PR

This section explains how to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure in one of the PRs
submitted to [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)
or [azure-rest-api-specs-pr](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr) repos.

Reproducing failure locally allows you to locally iterate on your spec changes
and keep rerunning LintDiff quickly until it passes.

LintDiff is running as an extension of the `autorest` command and the npm package name of LintDiff is
[`@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator`].
As such, you can reproduce the failure locally by running following command:

```bash
autorest --v3 --spectral --azure-validator --use=@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator@<version-tag> --tag=<api-version> <path-to-autorest-config-file>
```

where:

- You must install locally the **correct version** of the `autorest` command. See `How to install AutoRest` below for details.
- You must clone locally your PR git branch. The path to your local clone will be the prefix of `<path-to-autorest-config-file>`.
- You can obtain `<version-tag>`, `<api-version>` and suffix of `<path-to-autorest-config-file>`, relative to your local
clone, from the runtime build log of the LintDiff check that failed your PR. See `How to obtain PR LintDiff check
AutoRest command invocation details` below for details and examples.

Note that once you execute the command, it may take over a minute before anything is output to the console.

## How to install AutoRest

[Install AutoRest using npm](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/docs/install/readme.md)

```bash
# Depending on your configuration you may need to be elevated or root to run this. (on OSX/Linux use 'sudo' )
npm install -g autorest@<currently_used_version>
# run using command 'autorest' to check if installation worked
autorest --help
```

Note that as of 6/5/2023 the exact `<currently_used_version>` of AutoRest by the LintDiff pipelines is [3.6.1](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/openapi-alps?path=/common/config/rush/pnpm-lock.yaml&version=GCbd88a10303709fd617f57b914671647d4ca63eb8&line=109&lineEnd=109&lineStartColumn=13&lineEndColumn=18&lineStyle=plain&_a=contents).
You can install it with `npm install -g autorest@3.6.1`.

## How to obtain PR LintDiff check AutoRest command invocation details

Using [PR 24311] as an example, we will determine what is the exact AutoRest command invocation used both by the
production LintDiff check of `Swagger LintDiff`, and the staging LintDiff check of `~[Staging] Swagger LintDiff`.

### Production LintDiff CI check

To determine the production LintDiff check (`Swagger LintDiff`) AutoRest command invocation for the [PR 24311] (our example),
follow these steps:

- Open the [PR 24311] page.
- Click on [`Checks`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/24311/checks) and expand `openapi-pipeline-app`.
- Click on [`Swagger LintDiff`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/24311/checks?check_run_id=14029092663).
  - Observe the page says `compared tags (via openapi-validator `[`v2.1.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator/v/2.1.2)`)`, which foreshadows what we are looking for.
- Click on [`View more details on Swagger Pipeline`](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk//internal/_build/results?buildId=2824970&view=logs&j=0574a2a6-2d0a-5ec6-40e4-4c6e2f70bea2).
- Expand the `LintDiff` job and click on the [`LintDiff` task](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=2824970&view=logs&j=0574a2a6-2d0a-5ec6-40e4-4c6e2f70bea2&t=80c3e782-49f0-5d1c-70dd-cbee57bdd0c7).
- Observe the line: [`Executing: node /mnt/vss/_work/_tasks/AzureApiValidation_5654d05d-82c1-48da-ad8f-161b817f6d41/0.0.54/private/azure-swagger-validation/azureSwaggerValidation/node_modules/autorest/dist/app.js --v3 --spectral --azure-validator --semantic-validator=false --model-validator=false --message-format=json --openapi-type=arm --use=@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator@2.1.2 --tag=package-2023-07 /mnt/vss/_work/1/azure-rest-api-specs/specification/deviceupdate/resource-manager/readme.md`](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=2824970&view=logs&j=0574a2a6-2d0a-5ec6-40e4-4c6e2f70bea2&t=80c3e782-49f0-5d1c-70dd-cbee57bdd0c7&l=59)
  - Here, `node /mnt/vss/_work/_tasks/AzureApiValidation_5654d05d-82c1-48da-ad8f-161b817f6d41/0.0.54/private/azure-swagger-validation/azureSwaggerValidation/node_modules/autorest/dist/app.js` corresponds to the command `autorest`.
  - Observe the line has, using the variables from `How to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure occurring on a PR`:
    - `<version-tag>` of `2.1.2`,
    - `<api-version>` of `package-2023-07`,
    - and `<path-to-autorest-config-file>` of `/mnt/vss/_work/1/azure-rest-api-specs/specification/deviceupdate/resource-manager/readme.md`.
      - You must replace `/mnt/vss/_work/1/azure-rest-api-specs/` with your local repo clone path for local execution.

As a result, this information can be used to build the following example local execution command, using the template from `How to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure occurring on a PR`:

``` bash
autorest --v3 --spectral --azure-validator --use=@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator@2.1.2 --tag=package-2023-07 /path_to_local_specs_repo_clone/specification/deviceupdate/resource-manager/readme.md
```

   > **Troubleshooting**: if you get `error   | [Exception] No input files provided.` and you are positive the `<path-to-autorest-config-file>` is correct, then please:
   >
   > - double check you have cloned the correct repo (fork, if applicable)
   > - double check your clone has the correct branch checked out
   > - ensure the `<version-tag>` you used exists within the file.

### Staging LintDiff CI check

The process for determining the command for `~[Staging] Swagger LintDiff` is the same, as explained in
`Production LintDiff CI check`, except:

- You must drill down into `~[Staging] Swagger LintDiff` check instead of `Swagger LintDiff`.
- The AutoRest invocation will be slightly different. Here: [`Executing: npx autorest --v3 --version:next --spectral --validation --azure-validator --semantic-validator=false --model-validator=false --message-format=json --openapi-type=arm --use=@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator@beta --tag=package-2023-07 /mnt/vss/_work/1/azure-rest-api-specs/specification/deviceupdate/resource-manager/readme.md`](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=2824971&view=logs&j=688669d0-441c-57c3-cf6d-f89a22ccfa5d&t=b91b1e88-b042-5e18-36d8-34e4fb3a9b3b&l=60)
- You should expect exactly the same command, with one difference: for staging, the `<version-tag>`
  is always going to be `beta`.

# How to run LintDiff locally from source

To run LintDiff locally from source, you should follow the guidance given in
`How to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure occurring on a PR`
but with one major difference: instead of passing as `--use=` the value of `@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator@<version-tag>`, you will point to your local LintDiff installation.

This will allow you to not only reproduce any failures occurring in the CI, but also rapidly iterate changes to LintDiff
itself.

Steps:

1. Ensure you meet the [`How to prepare for a PR submission after you made changes locally`](#how-to-prepare-for-a-pr-submission-after-you-made-changes-locally) requirements **up to and including** `rush build`.
1. Prepare the `autorest` invocation command as described in `How to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure occurring on a PR`,
but instead of `--use=@microsoft.azure/openapi-validator@<version-tag>` use `--use=./packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest`, where `.` denotes path to your local clone of [`azure-openapi-validator` repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator).

   > **Troubleshooting**: if you get `error   |   Error: Can only create file URIs from absolute paths. Got 'packages\azure-openapi-validator\autorest\readme.md'` then ensure you passed `--use=./packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest` and not `--use=packages/azure-openapi-validator/autorest`.

# How to set a Spectral rule to run only in staging

1. Given a Spectral rule definition. e.g. [ProvisioningStateSpecifiedForLROPut in az-arm.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/225d507ede59ab5371dd84328422c9f525dca21c/packages/rulesets/src/spectral/az-arm.ts#LL82C5-L82C40),
you can disable it from running in production by adding `stagingOnly: true` property.
Don't forget to add a comma at the end!
   - The rules are disabled only for production runs. Staging LintDiff runs always run all enabled Spectral rules.
   - For an example of few rules being set to `stagingOnly`, see [this file diff](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/pull/506/files#diff-4c1382203db84bcd9df61a5bbf90823d0e1f39a833e8eaa1a5be96ca4a4e9b61).
2. Follow the instructions given in the [`How to deploy your changes`](#how-to-deploy-your-changes) section.

To re-enable the rule for production runs, delete the property and re-deploy the rule.

If you want to completely disable a rule then change its severity to `"off"`.

# How to verify which Spectral rules are running in Production and Staging LintDiff

You can look at the relevant build logs, as they output list of running Spectral rules, and if they are disabled.

- An example for [Production LintDiff run](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=2773189&view=logs&j=0574a2a6-2d0a-5ec6-40e4-4c6e2f70bea2&t=80c3e782-49f0-5d1c-70dd-cbee57bdd0c7&l=88).
- An example for [Staging LintDiff run](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build/results?buildId=2773190&view=logs&j=688669d0-441c-57c3-cf6d-f89a22ccfa5d&t=b91b1e88-b042-5e18-36d8-34e4fb3a9b3b&l=89).

# Installing NPM dependencies

```bash
rush update
```

This will install all of the npm dependencies of all projects in the
repo. Do this whenever you `git pull` or your workspace is freshly
cleaned/cloned.

Note that `rush update` must be done before building in VS Code or
using the command line.

# How to test

## Run all tests

To run all tests under the repo:

```bash
rush test
```

This runs both the `test-spectral` and `test-native` scripts as defined in `packages\azure-openapi-validator\core\package.json`.

## Run a single test

To run a single spectral test:

```bash
cd packages/rulesets
npm run test-spectral -- /path/to/test.test.ts
```

To run a single native test:

```bash
cd packages/rulesets
npm run test-native -- /path/to/test.test.ts
```

## Debugging tests

To debug a test, make sure you set a breakpoint and use a Javascript Debug Terminal when running the test. See
[Run a single test](#run-a-single-test) to debug one test at a time.

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running tests. See [the Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli) for more
CLI options, such as `watch` and coverage collection options.

## Error running Nimma

While running your test locally, if you run into an error with text:

> Error running Nimma

Try wrapping the `linter.run()` call in a try/catch block. This might help you determine where the error is coming from.
Remember to remove the try/catch block afterwards as it will interfere with test logic. E.g.,

```typescript
let result

  try {
    result = await linter.run(oasDoc).then((results) => {
      const paths = Object.keys(oasDoc.paths)
      expect(results.length).toBe(2)
    })
  } catch (error) {
    if (error && error.errors && Array.isArray(error.errors)) {
      throw new Error(`Errors found. ${error.errors}`)
    }
  }
  return result
```

# How to write a new validation rule using typescript

## Spectral rule

Please refer to https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjI1MTg5-custom-rulesets firstly.
and follow below steps to add a rule for azure rest api specs.

- add a rule config to the proper ruleset configuration in packages\rulesets\src\spectral.
  Currently we have 3 ruleset configurations:
  1. az-common.ts : for rule that apply to all Azure spec.
  1. az-arm.ts: for rules that only apply to ARM spec.
  1. az-dataplane.ts: for rules that only apply to data-plane spec.
- if needed, add a custom function in 'packages\rulesets\src\spectral\functions'

- add a test case, usually every rule should have one test, the corresponding testing files is in 'packages\rulesets\src\spectral\test'

- add a doc for the rule in 'docs', the rule doc file name is following kebab-case, contains following content:

```md
# <add RuleName>

## Category

<add one of the following>
SDK Error
SDK Warning
RPaaS Error
RPaaS Warning
ARM Error
ARM Warning
Data Plane Error
Data Plane Warning
ARM & Data Plane Error
ARM & Data Plane Warning

## Applies to

<add one of the following>
ARM OpenAPI(swagger) specs
Data Plane OpenAPI specs
ARM & Data Plane OpenAPI specs

## Related ARM Guideline Code

<add RPC code for ARM linter rules, example: "-RPC-Uri-V1-04". This is not required for data plane linter rules>

## Description

<add the description for the rule.>

## How to fix

<describe how to fix the violations.>

## Good Examples

<add valid json snippet>

## Bad Examples

<add invalid json snippet>
```

## Native rule

Since the spectral rule can only process one swagger in its rule function, the native ruleset is for complicated rules
which need to visit multiple swaggers.For example, if you want to have a rule to ensure two swaggers that does not have
duplicated model.

Differentiating with spectral rule, there is a swagger inventory (see below definitions) will be present in the rule
context to visit other swaggers different with current one.

```ts
export interface ISwaggerInventory {
  /* Get all specs that reference to the given specPath
   *
   * @param specPath the file path of the swagger.
   * @returns a record contains all the specs that reference to the given spec path, key indicates spec path, value indicates the json object of the spec.
   */
  referencesOf(specPath: string): Record<string, any>
  /*
   * param  specPath specPath the file path of the swagger.
   * returns the json object of given spec if given the 'specPath' or a Record<string,any> contains all the specs paths and objects if specPath is omitted.
   */
  getDocuments(specPath?: string): Record<string, any> | any
}
```

a sample rule config is like :

```ts
  rules: {
    my-ruleName: {
      category: "SDKViolation",
      openapiType: OpenApiTypes.arm,
      severity: "error",
      given: "$.definitions.*",
      then: {
        fieldMatch: "$..properties.*~",
        options: {
          match: "^[0-9]+$"
        },
        execute: pattern
      }
    }
```

Follow below steps to add a native rule:

1. add a custom function (optional) in 'packages\rulesets\native\functions'

2. add a rule to the ruleset configuration
   the ruleset configuration is in 'packages\rulesets\native\rulesets' folder, each `.ts` is a ruleset. there are 2 kinds:

   1. arm: for arm spec
   1. common: for all spec

3. add a test for the custom function

## Rule properties

- category: "ARMViolation" | "OneAPIViolation" | "SDKViolation" | "RPaaSViolation"
- OpenapiType: indicate which kinds of azure spec it applies to.
- severity: "error" | "warning" | "info"
- given: the jsonpath to match for the current swagger.
- then: the action to invoke for the matched 'given'.
  1. fieldMatch: the jsonpath to match the given json object.
  1. options: the options to pass to the rule function.

# How to run regression test

1. Init sub module.

   ```bash
   git update submodule --init
   ```

2. run test

   ```bash
   rush regression-test
   ```

# How to refresh the index of rules documentation

the [doc index](./docs/rules.md) is an index for searching any rule documentation provided in this repo.
you can run below command to regenerate it after you added or updated some rules in the 'docs'.

```bash
rush regen-ruleindex
```

# How to use the Spectral ruleset

## Dependencies

The Spectral ruleset requires Node version 14 or later.

## Install Spectral

`npm i @stoplight/spectral-cli -g`

## Usage

Azure-openapi-validator currently defines three Spectral ruleset configurations:

1. az-common.ts : for rules that apply to all Azure REST APIs
1. az-arm.ts: for rules that only apply to ARM REST APIs
1. az-dataplane.ts: for rules that only apply to data-plane REST APIs

All rulesets reside in the `packages/rulesets/generated/spectral` folder of the repo.

You can specify the ruleset directly on the command line:

`spectral lint -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/develop/packages/rulesets/generated/spectral/az-dataplane.js <api definition file>`

Or you can create a Spectral configuration file (`.spectral.yaml`) that references the ruleset:

```yaml
extends:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/develop/packages/rulesets/generated/spectral/az-dataplane.js
```

## Example

```bash
spectral lint -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/develop/packages/rulesets/generated/spectral/az-dataplane.js petstore.yaml
```

## Using the Spectral VSCode extension

There is a [Spectral VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stoplight.spectral) that will
run the Spectral linter on an open API definition file and show errors right within VSCode.
You can use this ruleset with the Spectral VSCode extension.

1. Install the Spectral VSCode extension from the extensions tab in VSCode.
2. Create a Spectral configuration file (`.spectral.yaml`) in the root directory of your project as shown above.
3. Set `spectral.rulesetFile` to the name of this configuration file in your VSCode settings.

Now when you open an API definition in this project, it should highlight lines with errors.
You can also get a full list of problems in the file by opening the "Problems panel" with "View / Problems".
In the Problems panel you can filter to show or hide errors, warnings, or infos.
