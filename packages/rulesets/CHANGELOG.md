## 2.1.6

### Patches

- [AllTrackedResourcesMustHaveDelete][TrackedResourcePatchOperation] Skip the api paths if it has PrivateEndpointConnectionProxy

- [RequiredPropertiesMissingInResourceModel] Updated the rule to also account for both GET and LIST properties, and also modified the `getProperties` helper method to include LIST.

### Patches

- Fix ResourceNameRestriction rule to exclude validation for system-defined parameters
- Update latestVersionOfCommonTypesMustBeUsed rule to check for latest version(V5) of all common types

## 1.3.2
Tue, 19 Dec 2023 21:25:29 GMT

### Patches

- Disable falsely flagging rules(RequestBodyMustExistForPutPatch, PatchPropertiesCorrespondToPutProperties, PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition) in PROD
- Fix RequestBodyMustExistForPutPatch rule to not check the body param name to be 'body'
- Fix null check for latestVersionOfCommonTypesMustBeUsed
- Fix trackedExtensionResourcesAreNotAllowed from flagging false positives
- Add linter rules to production pipeline and update version to 1.3.0
- Make XmsIdentifierValidation a warning as it isn't truly blocking and there could be valid cases when 'x-ms-identifier' isn't present in the array.
- Modify the rule AllTrackedResourcesMustHaveDelete to flag an error even when a Put operation is not specified for Tracked resources
- Fix documentation and add tests for the AvoidNestedProperties rule
- Update UnsupportedPatchProperties rule to include a check for properties.provisioningState property. The change is to ensure that provisioningState property is not updatable via a patch operation.

## 1.3.0
Tue, 05 Dec 2023 20:03:59 GMT

### Patches

- Fix fatal error caused by undefined parameters in ParametersInPointGet rule
- Update get-collection-only-has-value-nextlink.md to get-collection-only-has-value-and-next-link.md in order to match the rule name getCollectionOnlyHasValueAndNextLink
- Update docs and output message for PathForNestedResource rule to include details about the exception for extension resources and file a suppression request
- Update RPC-GET-V1-01(GetResponseCodes) to allow GET with 202 response code if the GET represents the location header polling url. Update RPC-Post-V1-09(LroExtension) to exclude GET from x-ms-long-running-operation presence validation
- Implement TenantLevelAPIsNotAllowed rule to check the existence of tenant level paths for PUT operation and guide through the process to get an exception 
- Fix resourceNameRestriction to handle missing operation parameters
- Fix an issue where PatchPropertiesCorrespondToPutProperties rule checks if the path has both PUT and PATCH calls.
- Add ConsistentResponseSchemaForPut (RPC-Put-V1-29) rule. The response schema of the 200 and 201 status codes of Put operation must be the same.
- Fix an issue with AvoidAdditionalProperties rule. This rule is checking the additionalProperties defined from common-types or other predefined references, when it shouldn't.
- Fix an issue where propertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition rules needs to check additional properties.
- Add XmsPageableForListCalls (RPC-Get-V1-13) rule which ensures that all LIST APIs must contain the ‘x-ms-pageable’ extension
- Modify ValidateSegmentsInNestedResourceListOperation rule name to MissingSegmentsInNestedResourceListOperation

## 1.2.2
Wed, 04 Oct 2023 17:01:43 GMT

### Patches

- Add EvenSegmentedPathForPutOperation rule that flags paths with PUT operation defined that do not end in {resourceType}/{resourceName}
- Add test cases for path-for-resource-action rule
- Add trackedExtensionResourcesAreNotAllowed rule that flags tracked extension resources, as extension resources may only be proxy
- Exclude not fully qualified extension resource paths in TopLevelResourcesListBySubscription linter rule
- Update PatchPropertiesCorrespondsToPutProperties to run in staging only
- Delete RPC-POST-V1-02(SyncPostReturn) linter rule as it is covered by RPC-Async-V1-11(PostReturnCodes)
- Change OperationsApiTenantLevelOnly to error for the path level instead of the operation level (#577)
- Change ReservedResourceNamesAsEnum from an error to a warning and make it warn for the path level instead of the operation level (#575)
- Add RPC codes to some existing rules
- Change severity of PatchSkuProperty and PatchIdentityProperty to warning
- Add a new rule RequestBodyMustExistForPutPatch that checks for the existence of a request body for a put or a patch operation.
- Add new rule MissingSegmentsInNestedResourceListOperation, this rules checks if the nested resource type's List operation includes all the parent segments in its api path.
- Modify PathForTrackedResourceTypes, this rule will check the path must be under a subscription and resource group for tracked resource types only.
- Disable rule PropertiesTypeObjectNoDefinition in production pipeline
- Add GetOperationMustNotBeLongRunning, this rule makes sure GET calls must not have LRO properties as GET calls are synchronous
- Removed LroPostReturn (RPC-Post-V1-03) rule and updated PostResponseCodes rule with logic to flag POST 202 responses that have schemas
- Add XmsLongRunningOperationProperty as new rule. This rules checks if any reponses headers have Location or Azure-AsyncOperation properties, then it must have x-ms-long-running-operation set to true.
